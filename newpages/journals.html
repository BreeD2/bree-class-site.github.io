J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h2><br><br>



<p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:0;color:lightpink;font-size:15px;font-family:verdana;text-shadow: 1px 1px palevioletred;">Handmade web is a word used to indicate code written by hand rather than by utilizing assigned programs. It also refers to initiatives produced by individuals rather than firms or enterprises. Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. 'Handmade web' can be used to advocate for continued active participation in the creation of web pages and online policies, or to call attention to the physical work involved in web page authoring. I believe the phrase "handmade" refers to how people code websites themselves and how others may observe their experiences and designs. Previously, I built websites with Wix and Adobe Spark, which gave me with all of the necessary tools, templates, and editors. Using such websites was beneficial in creating my portfolio and information websites, but it did not assist me in learning about "Handmade web." I believe that the word "Handmade web" is a fantastic term for describing how one may code with their expertise and learn about the many sorts of codes and how they can be utilized to customize their websites.</p>
